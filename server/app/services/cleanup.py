"""Photo cleanup: background removal → white replacement → crop-to-subject → levels.

All local CPU (rembg U2-Net + Pillow), no cloud. The U2-Net weights are baked into the
Docker image (see Dockerfile) so the container works offline. Degrades honestly: rembg
unavailable or removal fails ⇒ Pillow-only pass (levels, no background swap) — the
pipeline never blocks a draft on cleanup.

Pure-ish and synchronous by design (CPU-bound); the scan pipeline runs it in a thread.
