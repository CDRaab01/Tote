    It used to be a literal, and it drifted the first time it mattered: `pyproject` went to
    1.0.0 for the v1 release and this stayed at 0.1.0, so `/version` — which the hub and the
    deploy smoke both read, and which is the whole update story since the GitHub API cannot
    report a versionCode — confidently reported the wrong number on a freshly built image.

    Two strings for one fact will always eventually disagree; the only question is whether
    anyone notices. `pyproject` wins because that is what the build stamps into the artefact.
