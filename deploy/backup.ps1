.SYNOPSIS
  Back up Tote's database and item photos to a destination outside Docker (Windows /
  Docker Desktop).

.DESCRIPTION
  Tote's data lives in two Docker named volumes (pgdata, photos). Those survive redeploys --
  that is all docker-compose.yml claims -- but they do NOT survive `docker compose down -v`,
  a disk failure, or a host rebuild. This script is the actual backup: it writes a
  self-contained, timestamped set to a path you choose, which should be on different physical
  media (a NAS share, an external drive). A "backup" sitting on the same disk as the volume
  it copies is a copy, not a backup.

  The asymmetry between the two volumes is the whole point. The catalog rows are a list of
  paths; the PHOTOGRAPHS are the artifact. An item was in someone's hands in a garage and is
  now sealed in a taped bin in an attic -- losing the photos volume means the only way to
  restore what a bin contains is to carry fourteen of them down and open every one. Losing
  the database is bad; losing the photos is the thing the app existed to prevent.

  Each run produces:
    <BackupDir>\tote-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss\
      db.dump        - pg_dump custom format (-Fc), restore with pg_restore
      photos.tar.gz  - the /data/photos volume, gzipped tar
      MANIFEST.json  - sizes, counts, deployed commit, and the verification result

  The script VERIFIES what it wrote before reporting success: a backup that silently produces
  empty archives is worse than no backup, because it is trusted. This host has already proved
  that the hard way -- the nightly DB job produced nothing for two weeks while
  Get-ScheduledTask still reported State=Ready.

  Restore instructions live in deploy/README.md ("Restoring from a backup").

  Ported from Crate's deploy/backup.ps1, which solved the same problem for the same reasons.
  The differences worth knowing are the app name, the compose project, and the fact that
  Tote's photo set is expected to be LARGER: a household inventory photographs everything,
  where an eBay archive photographs only what is being sold.

.PARAMETER BackupDir
  Where to write the timestamped backup folder. Point this at other physical media.
  Defaults to the TOTE_BACKUP_DIR environment variable, else <repo>\..\tote-backups.

.PARAMETER Keep
  How many timestamped backup folders to retain; older ones are deleted after a successful
  run. Defaults to 14. Pass 0 to disable pruning.

.PARAMETER SkipPhotos
  Back up the database only. Useful for a quick pre-migration snapshot; the photo archive is
  the slow part. Recorded in the manifest so verification does not later mistake the missing
  archive for a failure.

.PARAMETER Verify
  Verify the most recent existing backup in -BackupDir and exit without writing a new one.
  Use this to confirm a scheduled job is really producing restorable sets.

.EXAMPLE
  powershell deploy/backup.ps1 -BackupDir \\Diskstation\Media2\Backups\Tote

.EXAMPLE
  powershell deploy/backup.ps1 -Verify

.NOTES
  On the Dragonfly host this is not called directly on a schedule. C:\Scripts\Backup-ToteArchive.ps1
  wraps it and owns scheduling, gpg encryption, NAS delivery, retention and logging -- the same
  division of labour as Crate. This script's job is to produce a VERIFIED set; the wrapper's job
  is to get it off the machine safely.
